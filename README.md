# Google Drive File Manager

## Overview

This application is designed to manage files in Google Drive. Users can view, upload, download, and delete files. The app integrates with the Google Drive API for file operations and uses OAuth 2.0 for user authentication. It is built with React and Material-UI for the user interface and Axios for API requests.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the development environment, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js**
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Clone the Repository

[GitHub Cloning a Repository Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository)

### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:
```
REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000
REACT_APP_SCOPES=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive
```

### Configure Google API

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project:**
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project or select an existing one.

2. **Enable Google Drive API:**
   - Navigate to **APIs & Services > Library**.
   - Search for "Google Drive API" and enable it for your project.

3. **Set Up OAuth 2.0 Credentials:**
   - Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
   - Click **Create Credentials** and select **OAuth 2.0 Client ID**.
   - Configure the consent screen if prompted.
   - Set the application type to **Web application** and configure the **Authorized redirect URIs** (e.g., http://localhost:3000).
   - Note the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** provided.

## Running the Application

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

## Running Tests

To run the Jest unit and integration tests, execute:
```bash
npm test
```

## Assumptions

- **Google OAuth 2.0:** Assumes users authenticate using Google OAuth 2.0 with predefined CLIENT_ID, REDIRECT_URI, and SCOPES.
- **API Access:** Assumes proper configuration of API credentials and scopes in the Google Developer Console, and registration with the correct redirect URI.
- **Access Token Storage:** Assumes that the access token is stored in `localStorage` and may expire or become invalid.
- **Error Handling:** Basic error handling is implemented. Further error handling may be needed for production use.
- **File Types:** Assumes support for exporting Google Drive files to formats like Word, Excel, and PPT.

## Design Decisions

### Component Structure

- **Auth Component:** Handles user authentication and token retrieval. On successful login, it saves the access token in `localStorage` and redirects the user.
- **FileUpload Component:** Manages file uploads to Google Drive using multipart form data for file metadata and the file itself.
- **FileList Component:** Displays a list of files from Google Drive, including name, type, and last modified date. Provides options to download or delete files.

### API Integration

- **FileList Service (`listFiles`):** Fetches files from Google Drive using a GET request with Authorization headers. Handles unauthorized errors and token expiration.
- **FileUpload Service:** Uploads files to Google Drive using multipart/related content type, including metadata and the file.

### UI/UX Considerations

- **File Display:** Uses Material-UIâ€™s List and ListItem components. Displays the last modified date using `Date.prototype.toLocaleString()` for better readability.
- **Error Handling:** Shows errors in a Typography component. Provides feedback for upload failures and session expiration.
- **Loading Indicators:** Uses LinearProgress to show file upload progress.

### Authentication Flow

- **OAuth URL Generation:** Constructs the OAuth URL with parameters for authentication and token retrieval.
- **Token Parsing:** Extracts the access token and token type from the URL hash after successful authentication.

### State Management

- **React State:** Utilizes React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for managing state, including file list, authentication token, and error messages.
- **File Management:** Implements functions for handling file uploads, downloads, and deletions, updating the UI as needed.

### Code Comments and Documentation

- **Added Comments:** The code includes comments explaining complex logic, API request handling, and UI updates to aid understanding.

## Future Considerations

- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Implement more comprehensive error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
- **Security Improvements:** Ensure secure storage of tokens. Implement token refresh logic to handle token expiration. 
- **Performance Optimization:** Optimize performance for handling large file lists and uploads.
